 I deployed the Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP honeypot. One of the issues, I encountered was following the steps, and making sure I typed the right commands as it easy to make small mistakes while typing out the commands. I had a total of 120 attacks on my honeypot, in a few hours.  Most of the attacks came from China and US. Many other countries, such Canada and Russia were also leading. The pcap protocol for the attack was common. I was interested in finding out how the attacks will change and increase in the next few days. 

The 5 attacked ports were:
1. 3306 ( 171 times)
2. 23 ( 78 times)
3. 5060 ( 74 times)
4. 445 ( 30 times)
5. 80  ( 27 times)
